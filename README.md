# Minesweeper
My own version of Minesweeper (mainly its Windows XP version).

The classic minesweeper with a twist: a square can now contain multiple mines.

All the functionalities (that I know) from Windows XP's Minesweeper, including
chording, has been implemented.

This project was originally developped by me using Dev-C++. If one wishes to build it
into an executable, he may have to add MultiSweeper.ico into resource.rc and modify
line 225 of main.c.

The executable creates a save file multmine.sav in the user's APPDATA, under a
directory called MineSweeper.
